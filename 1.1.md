# Go Setup

## Local install (macOS)

The easiest way to install go is with [brew](https://brew.sh), macOS' package manager.

```bash
brew install go
```

To ensure it has been installed, you can type:
```bash
go version
# or
go env
```

## Exercises

Where is go _actually_ installed? See anything in `go env` that is similar?

Hints:
- `which <command>` locates a binary.
- `ls -l <file>` will tell you if it's a symlink.
- a symlink can point to another symlink!

## Further reading

The [go playground](https://play.golang.org/) is a great resource to quickly test snippets ofcode.

`go env`
`which go`
"unit test" -> practice example

branch vs fork
CI in monorepo thoughts
make it easy to go through the repo and just do self-eval
