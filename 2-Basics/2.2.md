# Variables


## Concepts

Golang is statically typed: the compiler needs to know the types of all variables during compilation.

Go can either infer the type, or the developer can explicitly tell the compiler what the type is when declaring variables.

|  | Inferred Type | Explicit Type |
|--|--|--|
|Declaration |  impossible | `var x int` |
|Declaration and assignment | `var x = 4`<br>or<br>`x := 4`| `var x int = 4`
| Assignment | `x = 4`<br>(inferred from declaration) | impossible |

The last row, assignment, can only be done after the variable has been declared:

```go
var x int       // declare
x = 4           // assign

var y int = 5   // declare and assign
y = 6           // assign

z := 7          // declare and assign
z = 8           // assign

e = 1           // undefined: e
```

### Zero Values

What is the value of a variable when you have declared but not assigned?

Exercise: Discover the zero values of `int`, `float64`, `bool` and `string` by writing a go program

Tips:
- you will want to declare but not assign variables
- you can use `fmt.Println` to see the values

### Multiple variables


Similar to `import`, there is a shorthand to declare multiple variables:

```go
var (
  x int
  y string = "hello"
  z float64 = 2.1
)
```

### Constants

To declare constants, you can use the keyword `const`:

```go
const x = 4
const y float64 = 4
const (
  a = "hello"
  b = "hello"
  c = "hello"
)
```

One difference between const and var: expressions are implicitly repeated in a parenÂ­thesized const declaration

```go
const (
  a = "hello"
  b
  c
)
```

### iota

`iota` represents successive integer constants 0, 1, 2 ... and is reset after every occurrence of the `const` keyword.

```go
const (
  zero = 0
  one = 1
  two = 2
)
```
can be written as
```go
const (
  zero = iota
  one
  two
)
```

You can also take advantage of `iota` in more complex expressions:

```go
const (
  one = iota + 1
  two
  three
)
```

### Organization

Variables and constants can be declared at the package level, or the function level.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

var (
  x int = 4
)

func main() {
  printX()
}

func printX() {
  fmt.Println(x)
}
```

When variables are declared at the package level, you can capitalize them to make them **exported variables**:
```go
// pkg/example/num.go
package example

var (
  Big int = 1<<100 // bitshift operator
  small int = 0
)
```
```go
// main.go
package main
import (
  "github.com/user/project/pkg/example"
  "fmt"
)

func main() {
  fmt.Println(example.Big)
  fmt.Println(example.small) // breaks
}
```
