# Control Flow

Now that we have variables, we can begin adding control logic.

## Concepts

### If-else

All control logic goes inside a function

```go
func main() {
  x := rand.Int()
  if x < 20 {
    fmt.Println(x)
  }
}
```

`x < 20` is a **boolean expression**.
You can put any boolean expression in an if statement:

```go
if ((x < 20) && (x != 15)) || (x > 100) {
  ...
}
```

You can also include a statement before the boolean expression:

```go
if x := 12 * 17; x < 20 {
  ...
}
```

You can also use `else` and `else if`:
```go
if x := 12 * 17; x < 20 {
  ...
} else if x < 30 {
  ...
} else {
  ...
}
```

### Switch

Switch statements help reduce complexity of many if branches.

```go
i := "Monday"
switch i {
case "Monday":
  fmt.Println(":(")
case "Tuesday", "Wednesday":
  fmt.Println(":|")
default:
  fmt.Println(":)")
}
```

Let's dissect this:

`switch i`: `i` is a **primary expression** that will be compared with each `case`.

`case "Monday"`: if `i` matches `Monday`, execute the block and exit the switch statement.

`case "Tuesday", "Wednesday"`: if `i` matches either of these days, execute and exit the switch statement.

`default`: similar to the `else` block.

Switch statements can be written without the initial primary expression also, if the case expressions are boolean:

```go
i := 10
switch {
case i < 5:
  ...
case i > 100 && i < 200:
  ...
default:
  ...
}
```

### For
`for` can operate as a 3 statement for loop (similar to c), a while loop, and an infinite loop

```go
for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
  fmt.Println(i)
}

i := 0
for i < 5 {
  fmt.Println(i)
  i = i + 2
}

for {
  ...
}
```

### break / continue

`break` allows you to exit a loop before the for condition is met:

```go
for i := 5; i < 200; i++ {
  if i > 12 && i % 2 == 0 {
    break
  }
}
```

`continue` allows you skip the iteration of code and continue at the top of the for loop.

```go
for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
  if i % 2 == 0 {
    continue
  }
  fmt.Println(i) // Only prints odds
}
```

### Defer

`defer` tells the compiler to run a function before exiting the current function. This is often used to keep cleanup code near instantiating code.

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "os"
)

func main() {
  f, err := os.Create("test.json")
  if err != nil {
    panic(err)
  }
  defer f.Close()

  fmt.Fprintln(f, "test!") // f.Close has not yet been called
} // f.Close has been called
```

### Panic

`panic` is used when something has gone wrong, and you _don't_ want to handle the error. If you would like to use error handling, you can use the `error` type that will be discussed later.

```go
...

func main() {
  x := rand.Int()
  if x > 100 {
    panic("Number too large for function") // Clearly a contrived example.
  }
  someFunction(x)
}
```

Although `panic` is _generally_ used when you don't want to exit without handling the error, you _can_ catch the error with `recover`

```go
...

func main() {
  defer func() {
		if a := recover(); a != nil {
			fmt.Println("RECOVER", a)
    }
  }()

  x := rand.Int()
  if x > 100 {
    panic("hello")
  }
}
```

Here we can see we've deferred an anonymous function that tries to recover.
