# Goroutines

## Concepts

**goroutines** are how go programs can do work concurrently.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    go sayHi("Andrew")
    go sayHi("Beavis")
    go sayHi("Cory")
    time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
}

func sayHi(name string) {
    fmt.Printf("Hi %s\n", name)
}

```

If we run this 3 times, we could see 3 different orderings of names because each sayHi is run concurrently.

We need the time.Sleep at the end because if `main` exits while the goroutines are running, the program will end.

Next we will take a look at how to orchestrate goroutines and share state.
