# Control Flow

Now that we have variables, we can begin add control logic.

## If-else
All control logic goes inside a function
```go
func main() {
  x := 10
  if x < 20 {
    y := 2
    fmt.Println(y)
  }
}
```

One thing to note -- similar to c-type languages, variables
go out of scope when the bracket they are defined in ends.

`x < 20` is a boolean expression because it evaluates to true or false.
You can put any boolean expression in an if statement:

```go
if ((x < 20) && (x != 15)) || (x > 100) {
  ...
}
```

## For
`for` can operate similarly to c-type languages

```go
for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
  fmt.Println(i)
}
```

It can also be used as a while loop:
```go
i := 0
for i < 5 {
  fmt.Println(i)
  i = i + 2
}
```

and finally an infinite loop:
```go
for {
  ...
}
```
